Clone documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This clone provides the necessary changes to build Apache TinkerPop 3.1.0-incubating
against the link:http://repo.hortonworks.com/content/groups/public/[HDP-2.3.2.0-2950 HortonWorks Data Platform distribution]. This repo will also
provide room for other combinations of Apache TinkerPop Incubating releases and
Hortonworks HDP releases. Also combinations of Apache TinkerPop Incubating releases
and releases of other major open source Hadoop distributions are welcome.

NB Currently, only branch 3.1.0-hdp-2.3.2.0-2950 is relevant in this cloned repo.

See also similiar work for hdp-2.3.4 on:
link:https://github.com/pluradj/ambari-vagrant/blob/tp3/ubuntu14.4/tp3/SparkGraphComputer.md[https://github.com/pluradj/ambari-vagrant/blob/tp3/ubuntu14.4/tp3/SparkGraphComputer.md]

Upstream documentation

Building and Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TinkerPop uses link:https://maven.apache.org/[Maven] and requires `Java 1.8.0_40+` for proper building and proper operations. To build, execute unit tests and package Gremlin Console/Server run:

[source,bash]
mvn clean install

The zip distributions can be found in the following directories:

. `gremlin-server/target`
. `gremlin-console/target`

Please see the `CONTRIBUTING.asciidoc` file for more detailed information and options for building, test running and developing TinkerPop.
